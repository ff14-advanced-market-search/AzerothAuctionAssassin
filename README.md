# Item Selection

Note the separate areas of the GUI app:

<img width="1643" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-28 at 3 58 43 PM" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/06ca3a75-1a31-4880-b2e0-2d32178aca34">

- Red for adding Battle Pets you want to snipe. (like `DESIRED_PETS` from mega-alerts)
- Green for adding regular items you want to snipe like recipes, transmog, mounts, toys, etc. (like `DESIRED_ITEMS` from mega-alerts)
- Blue for adding BOE gear with specific Item Levels and Tertiary stats. (like `DESIRED_ILVL_LIST` from mega-alerts)

If you have created these configurations before while using `mega-alerts` you can import them into the `Azeroth Auction Assassin` using the import buttons.

# Adding Regular Items to Alerts

The ItemID is a special name for each item you can sell on the auction house (not counting pets).

For example the following shows [item id 194641 for the elemental lariat](https://undermine.exchange/#us-thrall/194641).

You can find that id at the end of the undermine exchange link for the item https://undermine.exchange/#us-thrall/194641 or if you look it up on wowhead the url also has the item id https://www.wowhead.com/item=194641/design-elemental-lariat

[You can also use our item id to name lookup tool, which makes this even easier.](https://temp.saddlebagexchange.com/megaitemnames)

Setting the following and clicking on `Add Item` will add this to your snipe list.

# Adding Battle Pets to Alerts

The PetID is a special name for each Battle Pets species id.

The following shows [pet species id 3390 for the Sophic Amalgamation](https://undermine.exchange/#us-suramar/82800-3390).

You can find that id (3390) at the end of the undermine exchange link for the item next to `82800` (which is the item id for pet cages) https://undermine.exchange/#us-suramar/82800-3390.

[You can also use our pet id to name lookup tool, which makes this even easier.](https://temp.saddlebagexchange.com/itemnames)

Setting the following and clicking on `Add Pet` will add this to your snipe list.

# Adding BOE Sniping for ILVL and Tertiary stats

If you want to snipe based on ilvl, leech, speed, avoidance or sockets then you can check out the last section of our app. 

Here you can create configurations similar to the following inside the app:

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/9493bfc2-15d4-464b-8aa3-d6fbae0aeae6">

This will produce alerts similar to the following:

<img width="680" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/mega-alerts/assets/17516896/722e828d-fdbf-485e-82b5-b8bc08827e3a">

This example looks for 2 different items with over an ilvl of 360 with a speed stat because `"speed": true`:

<img width="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/b2cc91e3-1315-4f21-991c-281d379bf6b4">

<img width="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/mega-alerts/assets/17516896/1a7250be-e1fe-41f9-b056-a2dc3cfd3abe">


If we change this and also set `"sockets": true` then it will show items over an ilvl of 360 with a speed stat and a socket:

<img width="653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/f1e80777-b88f-4a6d-92fe-c90e786d9783">


<img width="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/mega-alerts/assets/17516896/53418363-caa7-4a71-b388-a270aef464eb">


You can also remove the `item_ids` or leave it empty to snipe for all items at that ilvl (warning this may spam so many messages it breaks your webhook, if that happens just make a new webhook):

<img width="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/b7dc7078-a83e-4bf6-9fbd-042ab6993b35">

Note that this is all going to a list so you can make as many different combinations and configurations for different items at different stat and ilvls that you want!

# How to run the alerts

Once you setup your data and add some pets, items or BOE by ilvl and stats then just save your inputs and hit start!

<img width="1639" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-26 at 12 57 32 PM" src="https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/assets/17516896/6e115afe-db3f-4f9f-8bed-e90fd4a6b934">

You will need the following to run AAA:

- `Discord Webhook` this lets the app send data to discord (a.k.a. `MEGA_WEBHOOK_URL`)
- `WoW Client ID` and `WoW Client Secret` these let the app make api requests to blizzard (a.k.a. `WOW_CLIENT_ID` and `WOW_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- `WoW Region` either `EU`, `NA`, `EUCLASSIC` or `NACLASSIC` (a.k.a. `WOW_REGION`)
- Then you need to set some items in either the pets field, items field or ilvl field (a.k.a. `DESIRED_ITEMS`, `DESIRED_PETS` or `DESIRED_ILVL_LIST`)


# How to update versions

To update AAA or change versions, please follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of `AzerothAuctionAssassin.exe` from [this link](https://github.com/ff14-advanced-market-search/AzerothAuctionAssassin/releases).
2. After downloading the latest version, delete the old `AzerothAuctionAssassin.exe` from your computer.
3. Place the newly downloaded version of `AzerothAuctionAssassin.exe` into the same folder where the old version used to be.

All of your data is stored in the `AzerothAuctionAssassinData` folder. As long as you keep this folder intact, your data will be seamlessly used by the new version of the app you just downloaded.

# Note on upload times

Blizzard only sends out new AH data to the API one time per hour, the rest of the time AAA will sit and wait for new data to come out before sending more alerts. You can see what minute of each hour blizzard releases new data for your realm [here on our upload times page to find when new alerts will be sent to you.](https://saddlebagexchange.com/wow/upload-timers)
