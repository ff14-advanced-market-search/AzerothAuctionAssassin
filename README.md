# Note on upload times

Blizzard only sends out new AH data to the API one time per hour, the rest of the time AAA will sit and wait for new data to come out before sending more alerts. You can see what minute of each hour blizzard releases new data for your realm [here on our upload times page to find when new alerts will be sent to you.](https://saddlebagexchange.com/wow/upload-timers)
